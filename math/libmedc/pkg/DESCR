The purpose of the MED module is to provide a standard for storing and
recovering computer data associated to numerical meshes and fields, and to
facilitate the exchange between codes and solvers.

The persistent data storage is based upon HDF format (like CGNS, a standard
developed by Boeing and NASA in the area of Computational Fluid Dynamic).

MED also provides structures to hold data on meshes and fields. These
structures are exchanged between solvers, hide the communication level (CORBA
or MPI), and offer persistence (read/write in .med files).

The main benefit of a common exchange format is reduced complexity of code
coupling. It also allows sharing such high level functionalities as computation
of nodal connectivity of sub-elements (faces and edges), arithmetic operations
on fields, entity location functionalities, and interpolation toolkit.
